# **Rafael V. Canseco — CS-499 Capstone Portfolio**

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone Portfolio for **CS-499 at Southern New Hampshire University**.  
This site represents the culmination of my work throughout the Computer Science program and demonstrates my ability to **design, enhance, and evaluate computing solutions** using industry-standard tools and practices.

My portfolio highlights experience across the following core areas:

- **Software Engineering**
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Database Design & Mobile Development**

Each artifact includes **original and enhanced versions**, detailed technical narratives, and **explicit alignment with the CS-499 course outcomes**, reflecting my readiness for professional software development roles.
